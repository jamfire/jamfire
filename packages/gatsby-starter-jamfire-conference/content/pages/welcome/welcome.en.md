This is a demo site for `gatsby-theme-jamfire-conference`, a GatsbyJS
theme that tries to push the limits of Jamstack technology to provide an
online conferencing space.

## Getting Started

Skip the details and head on over to the [starter](https://github.com/jamfire/gatsby-starter-jamfire-conference "Starter Package") if you want to get up and running quickly using [Netlify](https://netlify.com "Netlify") or [Gatsby Cloud.](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/products/cloud/ "Gastby Cloud") You will need to setup a [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) account in order to use the chat feature and user authentication.

Or you can one-click deploy to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/jamfire/gatsby-starter-jamfire-conference) or [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/dashboard/deploynow?url=https://github.com/jamfire/gatsby-starter-jamfire-conference) but dont forget, you need to setup your [environmental config](https://github.com/jamfire/gatsby-theme-jamfire-conference#seting-up-your-environment) for your site to work correctly:

## The technology behind this theme

If you're not familiar with the Jamstack, here are the basics: JAM is javascript, apis, and markup. It's the secret sauce to creating highspeed websites and applications. This theme falls more under the webapp category, but is served in the browser. Clear as mud? Good.

This theme is built using GatsbyJS, NetlifyCMS, and Firebase. GatsbyJS is for building high speed websites, NetlifyCMS for managing content, and Firebase for human interaction like chat, login, etc.

## Theme features

So what does this site do? It gives you an online conferencing space where you can manage multiple events without having to shell out the big bucks for propreitary software. If you are a ReactJS developer, you can customize this site to your likeing using [theme shadowing.](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/shadowing/)

This theme features the following:

- Customizable primary and accent colors - Uploadable logos and favicons per event - A Home Page - A Paginated Events Page - And Event pages... - User authentication

## Single Event features

- Lobby area to describe your event - Livestream/Video area for your event - A countdown and event timer before and during the event - Event schedule - Breakout rooms using Jitsi - Chat powered by Firestore - Q&A for your events most needed information - Customizable navigation labels to fit your event

## Content Management

This theme uses Netlify CMS to manage content. It was developed in such a way that the theme lives separately from your content. This means that you can keep up-to-date with new features by simply updating the theme without possibly messing up your content.

You will need your Github login where your site is stored to login. You can login by appending `/admin` to your domain, for example `https://localhost:8000/admin`.
